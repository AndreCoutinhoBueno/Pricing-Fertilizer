# Supply

The supply of fertilizers in Brazil consists of domestic industrial production and imports.

However, the majority of the supply is met by imports.

In the next phases of this project, production data declared by Brazilian industries and reported monthly by [ANDA](https://anda.org.br/) will be integrated.

For now, we will focus solely on fertilizer [imports](https://github.com/AndreCoutinhoBueno/Pricing-Fertilizer/tree/main/supply/imports).
