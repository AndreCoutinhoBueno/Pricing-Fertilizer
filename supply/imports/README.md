Brazil is by far the largest importer of fertilizers in the world!

Despite the focus on local prices, the international prices is the base:

In this folder, we will forecast fertilizer imports using the classical linear regression method, alongside the random forest regression method. Both methods will be implemented using what is considered artificial intelligence, more specifically machine learning, through the algorithms of the Python package [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Each forecast will be accompanied by confidence intervals, which will be calculated through exhaustive testing.

The tests will also include comparisons between hyperparameters used in the forecasting algorithms.
