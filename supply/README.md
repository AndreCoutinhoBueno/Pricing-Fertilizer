# Supply

The supply of fertilizers in Brazil is largely dominated by imported products.

In the next phases of this project, production data declared by Brazilian industries and reported by ANDA will be integrated.

For now, we will focus only on [imports](https://github.com/AndreCoutinhoBueno/Pricing-Fertilizer/blob/main/supply/README.md).
