# Supply

The supply of fertilizers in Brazil consists of domestic industrial production and imports.

In the next phases of this project, production data declared by Brazilian industries and reported by [ANDA](https://anda.org.br/) will be integrated.

For now, we will focus solely on fertilizer [imports](https://github.com/AndreCoutinhoBueno/Pricing-Fertilizer/tree/main/supply/imports).
