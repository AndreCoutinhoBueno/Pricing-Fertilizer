This project is promoted by [Andr√© Coutinho Bueno](https://andrecoutinhobueno.github.io/AndreCoutinhoBueno/).

Pricing involves predicting variables related to [supply](supply/README.md) and [demand](demand/README.md).


The demand has a reliable source of data recorded by ANDA as "delivery to the final consumer," with the source being the member companies of this entity.

We will start this project by considering [imports](/home/andre301267/git/Pricing-Fertilizer/supply/imports/README.md).
